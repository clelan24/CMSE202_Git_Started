    "Work through the following assignment, making sure to follow all of the directions and answer all of the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 25 points possible on this assignment. Point values for each part are included in the section headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is due roughly two weeks from now at 11:59 pm on **Friday Dec. 4th**. It should be uploaded into the \"Homework Assignments\" submission folder for Homework #5 in your D2L webpage. Submission instructions can be found at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: It is possible you are asked to do something you are not familiar with. That's why you have internet access. Do some smart searches and see what you can find! \n",

    "### Goals for this homework assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for this assignment is for you to learn about neural network implemented by __Tensorflow__ and __Keras__ to do some basic classification tasks. Unless you already have experience with Tensorflow or Keras or similar libraries, you will not understand everything about this right away. You probably haven't even installed Tensorflow yet. Don't worry, that is perfectly fine. We will walk through one example in detail. So don't worry if some steps seem arbitrary or look like magic to you! We've got to start somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. It is one of the most popular software package for training and inference of deep neural networks. [Keras](https://keras.io/) is the high-level API of TensorFlow 2.0. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, you need to set up the required software. You can follow the detailed instruction from the [installation guide of Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) which also includes Keras. In most cases, you can simply type\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install --upgrade tensorflow`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are ready for action!\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__ Following the installation guide, you should have installed Tensorflow V2.3.1, and   Numpy should be downgraded to V1.18.5. If you have trouble with installation or you run into issues with dead kernels, please check the versions of the packages installed and asked for help during help hours!\n",

    "\n",
    "If everything went as intended, the file should now show up on your GitHub account CMSE202 repository under the hw-04 directory that you just created. Periodically, you'll be asked to commit your changes to the repository and push them to the remote GitHub location. Of course, you can always commit your changes more often than that, if you wish. It can be good to get into a habit of committing your changes any time you make a significant modification, or when you stop working on the project for a bit."
